## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

This page has two break-points for Desktop and Mobile users.

- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

On desktop if you hover or focus the cursor you will see that I have added an underline to the Sign Up call-to-action.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid and a
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When it comes to web development, that cross brower testing is very important.
After testing my solution with my devices defult brower which is chrome, and some popular browers everything worked fine until i decided to test it against firefox which did'nt do well. Which forced me to go back to my CSS to do some corrections. That was the key take home for me.
